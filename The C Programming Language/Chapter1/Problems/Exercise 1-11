To test the word count program thoroughly, I would include:

Input that does not end in a newline, to see if the final line is counted.

Input with multiple consecutive whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) to ensure words are not overcounted.

Input consisting only of whitespace, to verify that no words are counted.

Input with no characters at all, to test the programâ€™s behavior on empty input.

Input with punctuation or non-whitespace separators to see if the word-detection logic is overly simplistic.

These inputs are most likely to uncover logic bugs in how the program classifies word boundaries and counts lines or characters.
