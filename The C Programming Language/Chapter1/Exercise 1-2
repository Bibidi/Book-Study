Q : Experiment to find out what happens when prints's argument string contains \c, where c is some character not listed above. 

A : C treats undefined escape sequences by ignoring the backslash
In **C**, only certain **escape sequences** (like `\n`, `\t`, `\\`) are defined.  
If a **backslash is followed by an undefined character** (e.g., `\c`), the **backslash is ignored**, and the character is treated as **literal**.

Example: 
``` C
printf("A\cB"); // â†’ prints: AcB
```

This behavior is **implementation-defined** but commonly supported by compilers like **GCC**.
