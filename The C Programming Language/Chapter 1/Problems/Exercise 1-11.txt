If I were to test the code, I would try the following cases:

Case 1: "   abcd efg"
This tests whether the program correctly handles multiple consecutive blanks.

Case 2: "hello world"
This tests whether the program correctly counts the last word when the input does not end with a blank.

Case 3: "           "
This tests whether the program correctly handles input containing only whitespace.
