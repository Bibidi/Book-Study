Suppose x_P, the address of short integer array P, and long integer index i are stored
in registers %rdx and %rcx, respectively. For each of the following expressions, give
its type, a formula for its value, and an assembly-code implementation. The result
should be stored in register %rax if it is a pointer and register element %ax if it has
data type short.

Expression    Type      Value                 Assembly Code
P[1]          short     M[x_P + 2]            movw 2(%rdx),%ax
P+3+i         short *   x_P + 6 + 2 * i       leaq 6(%rdx,%rcx,2),%rax
P[i*6-5]      short     M[x_P + 12 * i âˆ’ 10]  movw -10(%rdx,%rcx,12),%ax
P[2]          short     M[x_P + 4]            movw 4(%rdx),%ax
&P[i+2]       short *   x_P + 2 * i + 4       leaq 4(%rdx,%rcx,2),%rax
